LibGameAI is .NET Standard 2.1 library of AI algorithms for video games with a
focus on education.

The library is organized into several components, installable from
[NuGet] or [downloadable] directly into your project.

## Documentation

* [Decision trees](xref:LibGameAI.DecisionTrees)
* [Finite state machines](xref:LibGameAI.FSMs)
* [N-grams](xref:LibGameAI.NGrams)
* [Naive Bayes classifier](xref:LibGameAI.NaiveBayes)
* [Path finding algorithms](xref:LibGameAI.PathFinding)
* [PCG](xref:LibGameAI.PCG)
* [PRNG](xref:LibGameAI.PRNG)
* [QRNG](xref:LibGameAI.QRNG)
* [Util](xref:LibGameAI.Util)

## Status & Usage

This is very much a work in progress, and should be considered to be at an alpha
stage of development.

This library is currently used in the educational [Game AI Prototypes].
